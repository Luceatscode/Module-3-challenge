AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

Phase 1: Get prompts to appear.
Phase 2: Get prompts to work properly when answers are inputed.
Phase 3: Get code to work properly and input password# Module-3-challenge

I cited a code I used in my Javascript for my if statements.
My programer friend helped me get my code to work. https://github.com/joeybuenosdias
P.S. I worked on most of my code Mar 10 & 11. Ended up in the hospital Mar 12 and was unable to finish my project until Mar 13. Was having issues commiting to the correct repo and got help on Mar 14 from a TA to submit my project correctly. I'm sorry for the one commit for the whole project!
